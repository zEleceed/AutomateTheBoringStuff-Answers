Practice Questions
1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
True / False

2. What are the three Boolean operators?
if, elif, else

3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to).
"The and Operator's Truth Table"
True and True > True

True and False > False

False and True > False

False and False > False

"The or Operator’s Truth Table"
True or True > True

True or False > True

False or True > True

False or False > False

"The not Operator’s Truth Table"
not True > False

not False > True

4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?

(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) > False
not (5 > 4) > False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5) > True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) > False
(True and True) and (True == False) > False
(not False) or (not True) > True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
==. !=, >, <, >=, <=

6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?
Equal means that the values are the same, assignment operators assigns a value to the variable.
10 == 10 > True
Rob = 10
Bob = 11
Rob == Bob > False
7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.
Condition is when you're trying to filter through the code and only allowing the wanted expression in.
8. Identify the three blocks in this code:

spam = 0
if spam == 10:
    print('eggs')
    if spam > 5:
        print('bacon')
    else:
        print('ham')
    print('spam')
print('spam')

9. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
spam = 3

if spam == 1:
    print("Hello")
elif spam == 2:
    print("Howdy")
else:
    print("Greetings!")

10. What keys can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?
CTrl + C

11. What is the difference between break and continue?
    Break will stop the iteration of a for loop or while loop. While continue just moves on to the next iteration

12. What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) in a for loop?
They're exactly the same, will print from 0 to 9

13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)

i = 1
while i < 11:
    print(i)
    i += 1
14. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
import spam
spam.bacon()

Extra credit: Look up the round() and abs() functions on the internet, and find out what they do. Experiment with them in the interactive shell.
abs() = gives absoulte value
round() = rounds to nearest integer.
